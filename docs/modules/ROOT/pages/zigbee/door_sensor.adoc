=== *Device state*
Device in two main state: Not commission and commissioned. 

- Not commission: Device will goto sleep EM4, and wait button is pressing. If it
is press and hold in 10s, it will start Green Power commission mode. In this 
time, the Zigbee Gateway need go to commission mode too for adding this device.
After 60s, if it is not in any network, the device will go back to EM4. 

- In commissioned: Device will goto sleep EM2 and do 3 timer tasks and react 
with the event of MAG_SENSOR and BUTTON when their state changed. +
+ Task 1 is send all status, after reboot or in commssioned state. +
+ Task 2 is periodic send baterry status after 1 hour or 5 minutes based on 
baterry is ok or not. +
+ Task 3 is periodic send current status after 30 minutes. +
+ BUTTON is pressing and holding in 10s, it will decommission. +
+ MAG_SENSOR changed event: device will send status.


=== *Commissioning*
Using default implement of Green power stack in Gecko SDK (v4.0.2).
